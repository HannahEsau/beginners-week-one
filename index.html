   <body>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
   internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
   Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</body>


  <li>HTML is cool (&lt;ol&gt;)</li>
  <li>CSS is cooler (&lt;ol&gt;)</li>
  <li>JS is the best (&lt;ol&gt;)</li>

  <p>What do you need to create a website?</p>

 <p>Not much!</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)(&lt;ul&gt;)</li>
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)(&lt;ul&gt)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)(&lt;ul&gt;)</li>
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files(&lt;ul&gt;)</li>
</ul>
